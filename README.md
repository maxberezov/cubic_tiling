# Cubic Tiling Prediction


# Built With:
python 3.8

# Install Requierements

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Starting optimization process

Just run main.py file by typing ``` python3 main.py ```

Please, store your programs in programs_to_predict directory

In the main.py file you can change the path to your file ``` file_to_optimize ``` or heuristics that rounds predictions to the nearest power of two ``` power_of_two_heuristic ```

# Output Example

We provide output for three Machine Learning models that we trained using different feature spaces

``` python3
Yuki features prediction is 32

Liu features prediction is 32

Bruteforce features prediction is 32
```

# Template

Please, do not change the template (e.g. loop bounds, array declarations of the example file). It's necessary for correct feature parsing.
